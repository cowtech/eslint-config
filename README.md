CowTech style ESLint config

https://sw.cowtech.it/eslint-config

Starting from version **4.19.0**, it is now based on [standard](https://standardjs.com/) which will differ on only few specific cases.

## Usage

In your ESLint configuration file, insert one the following statement, depending on your use case:

```javascript
// ...
"extends": "@cowtech/eslint-config"
// ...
```

```javascript
// ...
"extends": "@cowtech/eslint-config/typescript"
// ...
```

```javascript
// ...
"extends": "@cowtech/eslint-config/react"
// ...
```

```javascript
// ...
"extends": "@cowtech/eslint-config/react-with-typescript"
